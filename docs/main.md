# Main Page

Welcome to the Luaxe documentation! Here you can find detailed information about Luaxe, specifically much of the Lua API available.

## What is Luaxe?

Luaxe is a client and server mod for Valheim. It hooks into many of Valheim's innerworkings and exposes them to our Lua environment so you can script gamemodes. Luaxe allows you to quickly and easily create complex gamemodes without ever having to restart Valheim or the server; simply reload your script, and it will be updated with all your new changes and synced to all clients.
