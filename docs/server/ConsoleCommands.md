# Console Commands

There are a few commands that you can use on the server while running Luaxe.

| Command           	| Description                            	|
|-------------------	|----------------------------------------	|
| `reload` 	| Reloads the Lua scripts 	|
| `stop` 	| Stops the server and closes the console. Might not work well. 	|
| `clear` 	| Clears all text in the console 	|

Note: you can override default console command behavior with [ConsoleCommand](./events/ConsoleCommand.md).
